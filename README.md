This is the repo for my newsletter that I send out to my friends every two-ish weeks. 
It gives me the same satisfaction as sharing something on social media without all of the baggage that comes with that avenue of social interaction.
I've taken heavy inspiration from Paige Wassel and Damon Dominique's newsletters as well as sadgirl online's free templates. 
I started this as a silly little project to help improve my html and css skills and it has really grown to be something I look forward to putting together.
