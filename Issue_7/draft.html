        <p> First, Aidan was in town, so we met up with Maeve and went to the Ballard locks, which just a few weeks
          prior (as documented in a previous newsletter) had been teeming with fish. But when we went, not a single fish
          was to be seen, only a mauled fish carcas that a harbor seal was playing with.

        <p> Then, Aidan dropped me off at a hardcore punk venue (or so I thought) so I could work security at a show.
          But it turns out that, it was really just a 2012 twee band show. (Pictured: the bathroom
          vs the band). There was literally a woman with a massive side ponytail who brought her french bulldog to the
          show
          and read poetry on stage as a special guest. (That feels like a sentence from a syntax semantics pset (any
          LING 3303ers, rise up))

        <p> Then, we had our company AI learning day. I left my photo facing Cara as a joke, but then I forgot to take
          it down so now it stays staring at whoever sits at that desk next LOL. We took these photos at an ai
          photobooth, that they set up for us, not sure where the orig photos go...or where the generated ones go....but
          we won't think about that.

        <p>To answer the FAQs right of the bat, NO, I am not eating them you sicko, NO I am not naming them, I cant tell
          them apart and they don't even respond to names anyways, and YES they will have babies hopefully. I just have
          three right now, but Ill prob get a few more this weekend. Apparently you can have up to 10 shrimp per gallon
          of water, and I have a 4.5 gallon tank </p>

        <p>To celebrate my shrimp comming home from the hospital (aquarium store), I gathered my closest friends and
          coworkers for a shrimp (baby) shower at my apartment. The name turned out to be perfect because I had to
          acclimate the shrimp to my tank by dripping (showering) my aquarium water into their bag with a pipet
          (Pictured is Carson giving the inagural shower). </p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>Then, inspired by watching milf manor a few weeks prior, I did a secrets wall. Everyone anonymously submitted
          a secret prior to attending the shower, I wrote the secrets on index cards on the wall, and we matched the
          secret to the person. I thought it would be a quick icebreaker, but it ended up taking like 3 hours LOLOL.
          That was mostly because I added multiple secrets of my own to add to the mystery of the game LOL.

        <p>The night ended with some board games, and I discovered that I live in an aquarium of my own (a basement
          apartment). Anyways, thanks for reading, and I thought I would share a secret with you in the form of two
          truths and a
          lie. Respond with which you think is the lie:</p>
