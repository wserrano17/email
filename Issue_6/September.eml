        <p> Hello. I've rebranded the newsletter yet again. Please excuse the construction. September is almost over eep
          eep. Im super pumped for
          halloween. I feel like this will be a big one. What should I dress up as? A ghost? A witch? I love props and
          the hat would be so fun.

        <p>My biggest update is that I will be a father! Last newsletter I visited a plant store near me with fish
          tanks, and combined with my general baby fever as of late, I got the idea to start a shrimp aquarium. </p>

        <p>Here is the tank so far. No shrimp yet because I still need to prep the tank. Its dusty from the substrate I
          put in, and the plants have yet to really grow. Also I found a planeria parasite worm which is bad news. I
          feel like a father baby proofing the house in preperation for a child. </p>

        <p>I've also noticed a recurring image of circles/roundness in my life. Why are plates and pans and pots
          circles? But also I've been byCYCLING a bunch. What is up with that? I need to seek out more triangles.</p>

        <p>Here are some photos I took when i biked across lake washington. My manager said that I should log my rides
          in strava. Do any of you use strava? I think it would be too dangerous for me. Maybe it would get me to climb
          more.

        <p> My credibility has been eroded these past two weeks as well. It began happening with climbing. I keep trying
          to get my coworkers together to climb before work or even before noon on the weekends, yet when the time
          comes, I flake and my coworkers end up going anyways. Its mostly because I wake up and just forget what I woke
          up for. </p>

        <p>The second incident was regarding 'la victoria' and 'valentina' hot sauce. Andres was saying how he
          couldn't find valentina hot sauce in Seattle. When I went grocery shopping the next day, I saw valentina hot
          sauce and mistakenly informed him that I had found the hot sauce. Then, he takes the bus to Fred Meyer and
          disocovers that there is no valentina, and I look foolish. Idk I need to regain my honor with my climbing
          friends and to Andres. Any suggestions? Have you ever went back on your word? What was the aftermath? </p>

        <p>Oh and I started Norwegian classes. The scandanavian language institute is the only place offering in person
          language classes in Seattle and they meet like 10 min from my apt. I should take swedish and danish next and
          ascend to <a href="https://www.timelessmyths.com/mythology/how-to-get-to-valhalla/">Valhalla</a>. I also got
          this cute cat phone case for my work phone.</p>
