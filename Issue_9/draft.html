    <h1>WILLY.B.BLOGZ</h1>
    <p>okayyy listen, I’ve gotten alot of feedback about the newsletter being too big, too small, bad on mobile. Idk
      what to tell you…im trying my best. All of the online guides are bogus, nothing works. You will just have to deal
      with it :sunglasses: </p>
    <p>Anyways, another newsletter, another selfie dump :dealwithit: I've divided this one into three threads. Socks,
      parties, and personal growth, but really they are all personal growth</p>

        <p>I went to this sock store and got socks for running because I keep getting blisters. But the socks are
          special because they have a lifetime warranty. So if they get a hole you can return them and they will replace
          your socks for free! All the birders at Cornell used them and my friends here convinced me to snag a pair (two
          pairs).</p>

        <p>With the socks, I was able to run all the way up to Greenlake and ran for almost an hour! I only stopped
          because my blisters were popping off. :curses: The socks still helped though. I think my kirkland signature
          socks would have shredded my soles. Running is so fun when ur not on the mt lebanon high school cross country
          team. Also sidenote: why do I look snatched in this photo?? post run buccal fat removal i guess!</p>

        <p>Sort of sock related tangent, but I got top rope certified! As part of the class, I got a two week free
          memebership to a rope climbing gym...but idk. Im a boulderer at heart. Rope climbs are so long and I feel like
          I'm about to barf at the end. Plus there arent that many cool moves? Hot take? idk. Was that the most Seattle
          inner turmoil ever? yes. Anyways back to socks. I
          noticed that my shoes are slipping off when my feet get super sweaty! So maybe I need to start wearing socks
          when climbing? Or just take my shoes off when im resting LOL.</p>

        <p>Oh and I rescued my socks from the middle of a busy intersection! I was biking by work one day and I noticed
          a really nice pair of socks laying in the road getting soaked in the rain and I was like 'omg those socks are
          so nice, whoever lost them must be so sad'. Flash forward to that night when I'm doing laundry and I notice
          that I'm missing a sock! And Im like '....urr jokingggg', so the next morning when I bike to work I stop in
          the middle of the intersection, pick up my sock and scurry off to the bike room. Here is a pick of my roadkill
          sock drying on my bike. Its doing better and honestly not a scratch on them.</p>

        <p>These past two weeks have been soo party heavy. Up until this point I was beginng to feel soooo country
          mouse with my cooking, running, climbing, and biking. I was craving the oonse oonse! But perhaps I got more
          than I bargained for...</p>

          city mouse never sleeps!!! We went to the bar and I got everyone playing slide! The table next to us started
          playing too! But only Iris was any good...I felt like everyone else was trying to beat me up LOL</p>

          There were still like 10 other people in my line of sight so the office was def not empty. But it was crazy!

        <p>Here is the family all together. I bought three clear shrimp but sadly one of them crawled out of the tank
          and
          died and another of the cherries crawled out of the tank and died as well...that was a rough day for me. But
          new life is brewing in the tank! See if you can spot all four shrimp in this image. There are to red, and two
          clear ones. </p>

          new that we both tore up our fingers LOLOL. But there was a photobooth that they set up for the first day
          celebration which was fun. I wish they had it every day. </p>

          photo. But I swear it was tastyyyy. I've actually ended up roasting like 4 chickens since I've been in
          Seattle. Again, sooooo country mouse. </p>

    <h1> Viet word of the newsletter: Thất nghiệp - unemployed</h1>
    <p>Okay Im going to be real and vulnerable. The reason why I stayed till 6 that one day was because I was in hot
      water at work...the thing I've been working on since literally starting this job was showing zero progress. Im not
      sure how much I can get into on here, but I was really afraid that I would be thất nghiệp...I bị lạc (review from
      last newsletter) for while,
      but it all worked out. Also fun fact, thất nghiệp looks and kindof sounds similar to tốt nghiệp which means to
      graduate. So I was reading a vietnamese comic about a guy comming home to his home village after droppping out of
      art school and I thoght that he came home and had graduated, but it turns out that he was unemployed LOL. </p>
