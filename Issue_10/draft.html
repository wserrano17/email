    <h1>WILLY.B.BLOGZ</h1>
    <p>Hello, to all my adoring friends! I originally started writing this newsletter about the power of friendship but
      then got distracted LOL. As you will see, I'm still stuck on how sickeningly Seattle I have become. Anyways, I got
      good feedback
      about the formatting on last newsetter, so I'm gonna keep it the same this time. I would say if it aint broke dont
      fix it, but the newsletter is def broken so idk, maybe I should fix it. Also, this is issue 10 of the newsletter!
      Isn't that amazing! I didn't think I would be able to make it this long. Im so proud of myself! </p>

        <p>Sorry to jumpscare you with a spooky image right off the bat, but I ran out to golden gardens and took the
          bus back home. And to get to the bus stop, the map said I just had to walk through a park, but what the black
          and white map didn't say was that I had to climb up a muddy, winding path through the woods. Luckily I brought
          my 4000 lumen led flashlight, but I literally felt like I was in a survival horror video game. A la Dead by
          Daylight. </p>

        <p>And the horrors didn't stop there. As I get to the top of the cliff, I see my bus glowing in the fog, and I
          board this empty, shut off bus which was also creepy. Like in my mind buses are loud and bright and chaos. It
          was so eerie to be in this dark, silent bus. Anyways, the bus eventually did turn on, and I got off to
          transfer to another, when, again throught the tendrils of fog, I see a woman with a violin case! So I
          introduce myself to her and we begin chatting about music and it turns out that she studied violin in college
          and we hit it off and I snagged her numberrrr, so we can jam out possibly !! (number 1 of 3) </p>

        <p>Okay I don't have a picutre of this, but I also got this guys number that I keep seeing around the climbing
          gym! (number 2 of 3) And I got the third number from a guy on the plane to Birmingham! He lives in portland
          and we chatted for 5 hours our dreams and about creativity and art and it was incredible (number 3 of 3). </p>

          see family I hadnt seen in a while and eat cookiessss. also hello to Jake
          flipping out in this photo LOL.</p>

        <p>TW:some of these are disturbing, but then I made this cute one of my cousin and his 6 clones in this pond.
          See if you can spot them :smirk-cat: We also played a buch of boardgames (which I don't have a
          picture for LOL). Shoutout Cara for getting
          me mantis, my cousins really liked it. And I also finally learned how to play clue LOL. I never
          understood/enjoyed clue, but now that I've played so many board games with my coworkers, I
          get it. </p>

        <p>Oh and I saw this climbing competition happening by my parents house that I'm so tempted to sign up for, but
          then that means getting on a plane...which is so gross to me. Maybe there will be a comp closer to home. </p>

        <p>We also went to the jennies ice cream store which was tasty! The jennies
          ice cream brand has stores which I didnt know until this summer. I got a delish cherry flavored ice cream,
          which I washed down with a cherry limade from the pharmacy/soda foundtain around the block. So another win for
          Birmingham and for cherries. </p>

        <p>And I've gotten back into typing tests. I remember sophomore year, when Eric and I were trying to make a
          typing test for a hackathon, I was struggling to hit 80wpm, but now Im cranking out 109wpm at 97% accuracy.
          Maybe its from more years of typing experience, or maybe its the newsletter :sunglasses:

        <p>Oh and here is my apple music replay. I dont really think this is representative of the music Ive listened to
          all year because the top 5 artists are all within 100 minutes of eachother. Thats like less than two albums
          worth of music. And I'm not confident as to how apple music categorizes composers, soloists, conductors,
          orchestras, chamber groups, etc... Idk they at least need error bars or more statistical analysis. I would
          love to know what artists I
          started listening to this year or artists I stopped listening to. Or the months I listened to music the most.
          Or give me the data and I can analyze it. Better yet, Ill develop the apple music data connector for my team,
          and we
          can really get the analysis started.

    <h1> Viet word of the newsletter: khác với - to be different from, giống như - to be similar to </h1>
    <p> Hello bonus word! If you've been keeping up with the newsletters, you may know I've been undergoing
      a transformation from <a href="https://read.gov/aesop/004.html">city mouse to country mouse</a>. (Though
      re-reading the fable, I'm not sure it applies LOL?) I feel very khác
      với myself 3 months ago. And I'm giống như my friends here. I've barely been playing the viola, and I've even
      paused my language classes for the
      holidays. But I also feel like the most powerful version of myself. Getting digits left and right, running all
      over Seattle, and exploring interests I never did before. And it was interesting going back home and materially
      seeing
      who I was before in my detritis from college, and who I am now in what I brought in my suitcase. Anywhooo, thanks
      for reading to the end. I look forward to reading and replying to your responses! How were your thanksgivings? Are
      you feeling
      powerful or weak? Are you happy with your spotify wrapped/apple music replay?
    </p>
