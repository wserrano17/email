        <p>These last three weeks, I was in my coorperate bag! First I biked to the seattle Kraken Iceplex for a
          corperate skating mixer for my department. I felt so old school. Like the office christmas parties of yore.
          Also sidenote, why do I serve in my bike helment. Am I crazy? Or is it giving?? </p>

        <p>Then I got my corperate patagonia jacket. I feel like I've totally made it in tech and I fit in with all of
          the other tech workers on the bus! Then I put on wiskers for the office halloween event! A bunch of kids came
          and trick or treated and they gave us charcuterie and pizza! </p>

        <p>Another sidenote, who let them have this many
          good
          cookbooks in the office kitchen. Like nobody is cooking through the momofuku cookbook on their lunch break. Me
          boiling an egg with my ramen was the most gourmet thing that has ever occurred in that kitchen.</p>

        <p>As for my out of office attire, I dressed up as garfield (2nd year in a row) last weekend and went out on the
          town! Garfield may
          hate mondays, but I LOVE customer success! I love props and the box of trader joes lasagna was so silly. Also
          I met someone dressed as legolas who was fighting off
          assumptions of his Targaryean blood. He would have def been a better Aemond, but his costume slayed so ughhh.
          For this weekend, I have nowhere to go, but I really want to dress up as a sheet ghost. I do have a spare
          white sheet....hmmmm</p>

        <p>Also I started running! Mostly influenced by Benjamin and Uma I went on a few short runs these past few
          weeks, and no, I didn't get strava, I went on a run with Cara who does have it. (and Carson but is an actual
          runner so this was light work no reaction)</p>

        <p>AND for those of you who remember the valentina hot sauce saga, I found the hot sauce in a cafe by work. I
          was so vindicated, so I sent it to Andres, who said he likes the extra spicy version...just give me a
          win please.</p>

        <p>I was influenced by Cara (who i inspired to start a newsletter :proud-father-emoji:) who includes math
          riddles in her newsletter. So I thought it would be fun to include a vietnamese word of the newsletter.</p>
        <p>the word is 'bị lạc' - to be lost (it sounds like saying 'be lack' in english but with Kardashian vocal fry).

      <td>
        <p> On the way home from the ice skating event, I got lost because I followed
          Jebron to the bus stop instead of the train. If you remember, I biked to the ice rink. I wanted to take the
          train close to my apt then bike home rather than bike the full 50 min back. Because I 'bị lạc', I started
          frantically texting my viet tutor because I knew I would be late to class. When I got onto the train, I sent
          this photo, and then when I sent this photo I realized that my backpack was wide open. Anyways that was so
          dramatic, but I lowkey popped off with the viet in my hour and a half of need.</p>

        <p>okay last thing, and I've def said this before, but all of the plants here like on the surface look normal,
          but if you look closer they are actually wild and crazy. Like look at the shapes of these leaves. If you
          squint (though i heard from glasses wearers, squinting helps them see things clearer?) they look like normal
          leaves/weeds, but if you actually look they are these wild fractal looking things. Like wut? Why don't we have
          this on the east coast? For my west coasters, do you think that the east coast plants are strange? </p>
