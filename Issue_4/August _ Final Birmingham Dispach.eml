        <p>Heyyy Divas!</p>
        <p>Twas the night before Christmas (me moving to Seattle) and all through the house, not a creature (Jake, my
          dog) was stirring not even a mouse! Actually many creatures stir in this house because my mom was stung by a
          scorpion last Thursday. I just learned how to spell scorpion trying to look up ‘should I go to the hospital
          for a Scorpion bite’. I swear there was a q in there somewhere. Anyways, we went to the hospital, everything
          was fine and Alabama has no toxic scorpions apparently. Has anyone else had an encounter with a scorpion? Ive
          literally never seen one in my life. </p>
        <p>Other major updates include me setting up this hammock, us changing the color of our dining table just like
          in animal crossing! and more cousins visiting. </p>
        <p>Also this is a notice to please respond to my emails. I feel like I’m sending these into the void at this
          point. I think people think that the questions I put in my emails are rhetorical. They are not. [insert miley
          cyrus gun] I swear there will be more fun updates when I moveeeeeee. </p>
        <p>I also found out that despite not being on ig or tik tok (though i am born and raised on pinterest) I’ve
          become the ultimate trendsetter. Earlier this summer, I got these sandals at a random yardsale bc I had been
          inspired by the clogs people were wearing in Seattle (bruh how many times have I name dropped Seattle in this
          email), when suddenly I find out that they are called fisherman sandals and they are one of the hottest
          footwear trends of the summer.</p>
        <p>And then, the real kicker, I got these headphones back over winter break because I hate my bluetooth
          headphones, and I didn’t want to spend alot of money on noise canceling ones. and lone behold the dare, the
          2012 tumblr KING of brat summer (also a Seattle native), has been rocking my exact same headphones. (and
          lowkey stealing my look hello jacket and tie).</p>
        <p>Idk what this means, but it probably means I am super cool! I’m still waiting for goggles and chip clips to
          become the fashion accessories tho. What fun summer trends are you into following? </p>
        <p>I don’t have many other interesting updates, but I will be expecting 30ish
          replies to this email!!!!!</p>
